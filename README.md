This is a simple tkinter gui interface for the py4web framework.

![Alt text](./Screenshot.png?raw=true "Main window") 


It's quite simple, but it:

 * works on Windows, Linux and MacOS
 * shows all the running py4web's instances with their details. You can launch their Dashboard or Homepage, view logs and even stop them.
 * allow you to graphically launch the additional py4web instances (as specified on the py4web-gui.toml file, which is created at the first runtime)
 

## INSTALLATION

Just copy the py4web-gui.py file in the main py4web folder. If you're not using the latest version of the py4web program, you'll also need the icon files under docs/images.

## REQUIREMENTS

It needs the psutil and tomlkit module, as stated on requirements.txt

## ISSUES:

None known



Enjoy!
