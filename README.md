# py4web-gui

This is a simple tkinter gui interface for the py4web framework.

![Alt text](./Screenshot.png?raw=true "Main window") 


It's quite simple, but it:

 * works on Windows, Linux and MacOS
 * shows all the running py4web's instances with their details. You can launch their Dashboard or Homepage, or even stop them.
 * allow you to graphically launch the default py4web app (with a 'run apps' options)
 


## INSTALLATION

Just copy the py4web-gui.py file in the main py4web folder, and the icon files under docs/images.

## REQUIREMENTS

It needs the psutil module, as stated on requirements.txt

## ISSUES:

Currently, I cannot activate the logging functionality of py4web...



Enjoy!
