py4web-gui

This is a simple tkinter gui interface for the py4web framework.

It's quite simple, but it:

1. works on Windows, Linux and MacOS
2. allow to graphically launch the default py4web app (with a 'run apps' options)
3. show all the py4web's instances with their details, and you can stop them


INSTALLATION
Just copy the py4web-gui.py file in the main py4web folder, and the icon files under docs/images.

REQUIREMENTS
It needs the psutil module, as stated on requirements.txt

ISSUES:
Currently, I cannot activate the logging functionality of py4web...

Enjoy!
